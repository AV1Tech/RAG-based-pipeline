# RAG Models Pipeline
## Overview

This repository provides a detailed demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Llama Indexing, Mistral-7B, and the OpenAI Vision model. The pipeline includes creating vector databases, generating embeddings, and retrieving relevant information based on a given prompt.

## Features

- **RAG Pipeline**: Demonstrates the full RAG pipeline including vector database creation, embeddings generation, and retrieval.
- **Llama Indexing**: Efficiently indexes documents for quick retrieval.
- **Mistral-7B**: Leverages the powerful Mistral-7B model for language understanding.
- **OpenAI Vision Model**: Integrates the OpenAI Vision model for advanced vision capabilities.
